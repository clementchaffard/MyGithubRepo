## Flir temperature image extraction
We used machine learning to identify body parts in thermal images and extracted temperature on specific parts of the body. 
The goal was to measure body cooling or warming to set optimal building air conditioning.

## Gender classification using speech recognition
We used a 178 million quotes dataset to identify differences in forms of speech between genders across multiple professions.

## Hand written digit classification
We compared different neural networks architecture and investigated the effect of batch size and penalization on our model to obtain competitive accuracy in handwritten digit classification.

## Predicting civil war onset
We compared difference machine learning approaches(SVM, Rd Forest, regressions..) on the major issue which is civil war onset to identify most important features.
